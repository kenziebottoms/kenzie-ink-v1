I'm a 21-year-old Tattooed and Employed&trade; kid with hair that is usually more than one color, a leopard gecko, an affinity for Oxford commas, and an unreasonable appetite for consuming and producing art of all kinds. I take unconscionable pleasure in writing (good) HTML and CSS, and less masochistically enjoy some wicked functional programming.
