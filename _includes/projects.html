    <h2>1. You're looking at it.</h2>
    <p>This site is running on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, which basically means I refactored my HTML, which might be the greatest thing ever to happen to me.</p>

    <h2>2. The Little <a href="http://www.codefugue.com/" target="_blank">CodeFugue</a></h2>
    <p>My dad and I conspired to code <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddbxFi3-UO4" target="_blank">the Little Fugue</a> in Euterpea, an ingenious machination of Haskell that lets you write Midi music. As if that weren't nerdy enough, we thought: Well. There are four voices. We could each code two... or we could each code one and each play one. A good video is forthcoming of the nerdiest little concert on the planet, but <a href="https://github.com/calvinb/little-fugue" target="_blank">here's the code</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Racket Dragon</h2>
    <p>I've done this project about four times in at least two languages. Basically what I did was make a program to calculate and draw iterations of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/DragonCurve_animation.gif" target="_blank">dragon curve</a>, a badass fractal rivaled only by the badassery of its namesake. I coded it very badly in Python, slightly less terribly in Python, acceptably in Python, and excellently in Racket if I do say so myself. The functional language was made for this stuff.</p>
    <p class="small">I met the dragon curve in <em>Jurassic Park</em>. The book. My favorite example of the dragon curve is the pattern formed if you fold a piece of paper back on itself as many times as possible and then let every fold open to a right angle.</p>
